<!-- // EXPLANATION -->
<Explanation 
    passageContext="Laying the scene at Susa, a residential city of the Persian kings, the Book of Esther narrates that King Ahasuerus deposed his first wife, Queen Vashti, after she refused to display her beauty to the people and nobles at the king’s feast. Seeking a new queen, the king appointed commissioners to bring all the beautiful young virgins from every province into his harem for a year of cosmetic treatments so that he might select a new bride. Esther, the orphaned cousin and adopted daughter of Mordecai, won the king’s devotion and was chosen to be the new queen; Mordecai had instructed her to not reveal that she was Jewish. Esther gained even greater favour with Ahasuerus after she helped thwart an assassination plot against him that Mordecai overheard at the palace gate.
    Esther’s story culminates when the beloved queen is faced with the decision to either continue to disguise her Jewish heritage and maintain her safety or jeopardize everything to advocate for her people" [^1]
