<!-- // EXPLANATION -->
<Explanation 
    passageContext="After leading the second Exodus of the Jews from Babylon to Jersulam, Ezra became overwhelmed with the sins of the returned exiles. During a time of prayer and weeping, he was confronted by a large assembly of Israelites who agreed with his assessment and responded with sincere repentance. What followed was a deliberate coordination by the Jewish people with the priests and leaders to rectify their iniquity. Every man who had married a foreign wife, terminated his marriage and sent away any children of their union. So careful were the people to ensure that every sinner complied that they took a total of three months to complete this process of obedience. "
