### **Explanation**

#### **Background**

> _Ezra apparently had official status as a commissioner of the Persian government, and his title, “scribe of the law of the God of heaven,” is best understood as “royal secretary for Jewish religious affairs,” or the like. The Persians were tolerant of native cults but, in order to avert internal strife and to prevent religion from becoming a mask for rebellion, insisted that these be regulated under responsible authority. The delegated authority over the Jews of the satrapy (administrative area) “beyond the river” (Avar-nahara), or west of the Euphrates River, was entrusted to Ezra; for a Jew to disobey the Law he brought was to disobey “the law of the king.”_ - <a class="!text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-teal-500 dark:from-violet-500 dark:to-pink-500" href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ezra-Hebrew-religious-leader">Ezra | Encyclopædia Britannica<a>

#### **Summary**

Ezra the scribe made himself ready to _consult_ the Law of God and to _obey_ it’s commands.

### **Application**

In order to receive divine - and earthly - favor, I must also make internal preparations to study God’s Word and commit in advance to obey the precepts and principals found therein.
