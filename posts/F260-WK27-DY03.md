## **Highlight**

<blockquote style="font-weight: bold !important"> 
<Gradient>Now therefore make confession unto the Lord God of your fathers, and do His pleasure: and separate yourselves from the people of the land, and from the strange wives. <br/> Then all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice, 'As thou has said, so must we do. <br/> But the people are many, and it is a time of much rain, and we are not able to stand without, neither is this the work of one day or two: for we are many that have transgressed in this thing. <br/> Let now our rulers of all the congregation sstand, and let all them which have taken strange wives in our cities come at appointed times, and with them the elders of every city, and the jugges thereof, until the fierce wrath of our God for this matter be turned from us.'</Gradient>
</blockquote> - Ezra 7:10

## **Explanation**

### **Synopsis**

> After leading the second Exodus of the Jews from Babylon to Jersulame, Ezra became overwhelmed with the sinfless of the returned exiles. During a time of prayer and weeping, he was confronted by a large assembly of Israelites who responded in sincere repentance. What followed was a  deliberate coordination by the Jewish people with the priests and leaders to rectify their iniquity. Every man who had married a foreign wife, terminated his marriage and sent away any children of their union. So careful were the people to ensure that every sinner complied that they took a total of three months to complete this process of obedience. 

### **Commentary**

Biblical repentance is a laborious task that involves not only penitent agremeent with the Sovereign Lord concerning my sin, but also personal accountability with spiritual leaders concerning my separation.

## **Application**

I have not truly repented if I do not take the time necessary to evaluate the benefits that I derive from my sinful actions and act in conjuction with an accountability partner to forsake them.<br/>

## **Response**

Lord, <br/>
Help me to not to accept an 'easy repentance', but to ensure that my repentance is truly sincere and entire.<br/> Help me not seek accountability and to be willing to keep another brother in Christ accountable. <br/>
Amen
